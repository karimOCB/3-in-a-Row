            "3 in a Row" (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) is a simple but strategic game 
            that often gets intense as players start to understand the logic and 
            patterns that lead to victory.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The objective is to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, 
            either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Once you understand the basic strategy of Tic-Tac-Toe, you'll find that 
              the game often ends in a draw between skilled players. However, if one 
              player is not familiar with the logic, the other can exploit mistakes 
              and win consistently.

                <StrategyItem title="First Move Advantage">
                  Always start in the center or a corner. The center gives the most 
                  control over the game, and the corners provide the best potential 
                  for multiple winning combinations.
                </StrategyItem>
                <StrategyItem title="Block and Counter">
                  Always watch for ways to block your opponent from completing a line 
                  of three. If they have two marks in a row, place your mark in the 
                  third space to prevent their win.
                </StrategyItem>
                <StrategyItem title="Create Forks">
                  A fork occurs when you set up two potential winning lines 
                  simultaneously, forcing your opponent to block one and leaving the 
                  other open for you to win.
                </StrategyItem>
                <StrategyItem title="Control the Center">
                  The center participates in the most potential winning lines. Control 
                  it, and you'll have more options for setting up future moves.
                </StrategyItem>
                <StrategyItem title="Play Defensively">
                  Against skilled opponents, focus on both offensive moves and their 
                  possible responses. Anticipating their strategy and blocking at the 
                  right moment is crucial.
